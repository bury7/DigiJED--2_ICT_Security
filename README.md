# DigiJED-2 ICT Security Projects

This repository contains projects created during the DigiJED-2 ICT Security course. Projects involve both practical and laboratory work. The practical work includes the following topics: setting up a local area network, a virtual local area network, a VPN, a wireless local area network, and protecting a router connection. The laboratory study included topics such as creating a virtual local area network, securing local area networks, securing wide area networks, and studying single-path routing methods for various metrics.

## Overview of the Course
In the DigiJED-2 ICT Security course, I've gained essential theoretical and practical skills for securing ICT networks. The curriculum covered foundational ICT technology, emphasizing the critical role of security in today's technological landscape. Topics included network vulnerabilities, LAN and WAN security, Access Control Lists, Remote Access Security, DHCP, DNS, ARP, VPNs, VLAN configuration, and routing security. Practical exercises, including network scanning concepts, enhanced my ability to identify and mitigate potential threats. Overall, the course has equipped me with a robust skill set to contribute effectively to ICT network security.
