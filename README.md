# DigiJED-2 ICT Security Projects

This repository contains projects created during the DigiJED-2 ICT Security course. Projects involve both practical and laboratory work. The practical work includes the following topics: setting up a local area network, a virtual local area network, a VPN, a wireless local area network, and protecting a router connection. The laboratory study included topics such as creating a virtual local area network, securing local area networks, securing wide area networks, and studying single-path routing methods for various metrics.

## Overview of the Course
In the DigiJED-2 ICT Security course, I've gained essential theoretical and practical skills for securing ICT networks. The curriculum covered foundational ICT technology, emphasizing the critical role of security in today's technological landscape. Topics included network vulnerabilities, LAN and WAN security, Access Control Lists, Remote Access Security, DHCP, DNS, ARP, VPNs, VLAN configuration, and routing security. Practical exercises, including network scanning concepts, enhanced my ability to identify and mitigate potential threats. Overall, the course has equipped me with a robust skill set to contribute effectively to ICT network security.

## More about the projects

### [Practice](Practice)

- Practice LAN
  
  During this practical lesson, two local area networks were configured using different devices, and address assignment was configured both statically and dynamically using the DHCP protocol.

- Practice VLAN
  
  During this practical lesson, three virtual LANs were configured, with and without DTP, and the VTP protocol was also used. It was possible to connect from each virtual network to another, as well as to connect to the global network with each virtual network

- Practice Secure Router
  
  During this practical lesson, security was ensured when connecting to the router directly, or via telnet or ssh protocols, as well as securing the router's privileged mode and encrypting all passwords stored in the router system. 

- Practice VPN
  
  During this practical lesson, we set up a VPN connection from one of the virtual local area networks to another network. The ISAKMP and IPsec protocols were used in this lab.

- Practice Wi-Fi
  
  During this practical lesson, we set up a wireless network, use different types of 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks, configure DHCP service on wireless and regular routers, set up a guest network on a wireless router, secure this network, and create an access —Åontrol list.
